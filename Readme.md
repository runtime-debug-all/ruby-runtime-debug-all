The repository is initially using defined?() method in ruby to tell me if an assignment occoured. Assignment will print adjacently, but print max 1 newline for any number of non assignments between previous assignment and non assignment.

output intended:

<b>it should</b> "print line number, var name, and var value"<br><br>
  ```line 10, testB, val 5 || line 11, testB, val 4 || line 10, testB, val 6 || line 11, testB, val 4```
  <br><br>```line 20, testC, val 2 || line 21, testD, val 3```
  <br><br>```line 24, testB, val 2```

  end
